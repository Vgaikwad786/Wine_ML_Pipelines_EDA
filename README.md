# Wine_ML_Pipelines_EDA
ML_project_along_with_pipelines

In this project I have using Basic Machine Learning  algorithms along with Pipelines to predict the best model accuracy after removing duplicates and missing values.
Then created EDA for better Visualization.
Measured the performance metrics along with classification reports and then calculated the mse, mae, mape, rmse to find the error loss then using confusion matrix we 
concluded the TP,FP,TN,FN values.
